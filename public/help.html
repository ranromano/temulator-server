<p>After adding all you friends, you can start dividing into groups. Mark all the relevant friends
and press Teamulate! You will be redirected to the 'Teams' tab to see who's against who!</p>

<h2>General notes regarding the project:</h2>
<p>The web application was built using the <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">ionic</a>framework,
 an open-source front-end SDK for developing advanced cross platform HTML5 mobile apps. Ionic is
 based on angular.js, making it familiar to a large javascript userbase.</p>
<p>Persistency is achieved via a MongoDB-as-a-Service named <a href="https://mongolab.com">Mongolab</a>
    , that acts as our user repository.</p>
<p><b>Have fun!</b></p>
